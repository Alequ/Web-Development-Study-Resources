### Basic JavaScript
JavaScript is the only programming language that can reach into a webpage and modify the content of the HTML or the styling of the CSS.

This section covers its basic syntax and control structures, which must be learned first.

### Functional JavaScript
Using functional programming is one of those weird things in programming that's actually more easily done than described.

Most of what FP means (at least early on) is using functions to iterate through arrays, rather than writing loops all over the place. It's more readable, and less error-prone.

### Manipulate the DOM with "Vanilla" JavaScript
The DOM is another concept that sounds scarier than it is.

The Document-Object Model is just the content of a webpage, parsed into an object so that JS can read and manipulate it.

### Manipulate the DOM with jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library that mainly enables DOM manipulation with more tersely-written code.
